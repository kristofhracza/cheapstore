A simple solution for stroing backups.

![showcase](./public/assets/show.png)

Have you had enough of paying for storage services? Are you afraid that your files are in the wrong hands?  
If yes, then this project is for you.



## Usage
It can be deployed locally and on vercel.
- Run `npm ci` to install all packages
- Run `node index.js` to start up the server.

Simply select files and upload them. The program will put every file into a `zip` and will store it on **YOUR** computer.    
The zip archives will be stored in `public/backups`.

## Note
This project was done overnight in a couple of hours, so bugs may arise as I don't intend to come back to this project very often.
